# Family Cash Card

Parents often find themselves lacking an easy way to manage (i.e. send, receive, track) allowances for their kids. So instead of handing out a stack of bills, our cloud-based Family Cash Card app allows parents to virtually manage "cash cards" for their kiddos. You can think of the cash card being very similar to a gift card that many of us send and receive. The primary goal of the Family Cash Card app is to give parents ease and control over managing funds for their children.

We'll use Spring Boot to progress from creating a single cash card in a database to allowing for the editing, deleting, and viewing of multiple cash cards, and finally securing the app against unauthorized access and unwanted exploits.

This Spring Boot application covers the following Spring Boot components

*    Utilizes Spring Boot to build a complete RESTful API
*    Spring Web to Build a web application
*    Uses Spring Data to connect databases and map relational data to Java objects.
*    Uses Spring Security to develop software with a Security First approach.
